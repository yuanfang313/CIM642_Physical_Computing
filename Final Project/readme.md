 * ## Proposal_3.0__Play with Animatronic Eyes
 
 **_Play with Animatronic Eyes_** is modified from **_Wake Up an Egg 2_**, for I found that it is really not easy to add animatronic eyes onto a coved face. Therefore, I separate the part of eyes to make it a project that mainly aim at exploring the physical machenism of animatronic eyes.
 
 * ### Concept
 
  The Eyes of human are the part that can express many emotions, which also can easily trigger the emotions of others.
  So if I want to explore the question that how to influence the emotion of my users, make an installation of Animatronic     Eyes is definitely an idea worth trying.

 * ### Procedure
 
   * ### Modify Model
   
  The problems of the original design mainly come form two aspects: 
  -the distance between 3D printing parts on the plate are too short;
  -the structure of the joints connecting the upper and lower eyelids are not functionning well with 3D printing;
  
  So I made some adjustings.
  
  #### Amplify the distance;

  #### Change the structure of the joints;

 * ## Proposal_2.0__Wake Up an Egg 2
 
 &nbsp;
 
 #### 1) What I want to do with **_Wake Up an Egg 2_**
 In the **_Wake Up an Egg 1_**, audiences can just feel that there is something alive inside the egg. 
 
 I expect, in the next stage in this "Wake Up" serial, there will be **an eye opening on the egg**.
 
 &nbsp;
 
 #### 2) Why do I want to "open eye" on the egg?
 
 Obviously, it is not only because this behavior is logically sound in the "wake up" process in the real life, 
 but also because the attention of people is very easy to be attracted by the face of human, and the most attactive part 
 on the face is eyes.
 
 I remenber I was so obsessed with drawing different kinds of eyes of people when I was a little kid.
 And oftentimes, I only drew eyes, because that was already enough for me to imagine what kind of people were these eyes belong to.
 
 So I think it is a good idea to create eyes on my project to personificate it, if I want it relating with audiences emotionally.
  
 &nbsp;
  
 #### 3) How can I "open eyes" on the egg?
 
 * **OUTPUT:** First of all, I need to learn the mechanism of opening an robotic eye:
 
``` 
 - the structure that I need to 3D print out;
 - the components that I need to drive the movements of eyeball and eyelid；
 
```
 
 
 * **INPUT:** Second, figure out what kinds of behaviors I want my audiences to perform to control the movements of robotic eyeball and eyelid. How do these behaviors make sense to them?
 
 ``` 
 - the components (sensers) that I need to trigger the movements of eyeball and eyelid；
 - the locations of these components (sensers)；
```

 * ## Proposal_1.0__Flocking in the Breath
 
 &nbsp;
 
 #### 1) What is **_Flocking in the Breath_**
 
Basically it is a project that bulding a connection between the "flocking" patterns in the nature and the the "breath" pattern of ourselves. 

When audiences breath, they will hear the sound of their breath translated to the sound of "flocking" in the nature, and visualized at the same time.
 
 &nbsp;
 
 #### 2) Why do I want to combine "flocking" with "breath"?
 
**One in All & All in One**

**一即全， 全即一**

I'm alway interested in one part of Chinese culture, which is ecouraging people to be compliant with Nature by imitating the patterns in the nature.

In the antient times, from royalty to common people, to some extents all the activities of our ancestors were roled by the patterns in the nature.

The rules about what we need to do and eat in the 24 different seasons throughout a year;
The rules about waking up with the sunrise and laying done with the sunset;
The rules about practicing different exercises in different periods within a day;

...

Obviously, people would have bigger chance to survive by obeying this rules in the past.

However, it is very interesting that with the resources and technologies provided by modern society today, most Chinese I think still keep these rules in mind -- maybe subconsciously.


All these rules seemed coming from an old phylosophy that we call “天人合一”， which means man is an integral part of nature.

“天人合一” is used to discribe a kind of realm of spirit.

In the surface, I think we can realize it by combining the patterns on ourselves with the patterns of nature.

Flocking pattern of birds or fish or any other creatures is the one of what I'm most interested among all the patterns in nature. It is like the breath of nature. 

By connecting flocking pattern with breath pattern, I want to encourage audiences to discover their own connections with nature, to find the whole nature inside themselves.
