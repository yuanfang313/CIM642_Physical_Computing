 * ## Proposal_1.0__Wake Up an Egg 2
 
 &nbsp;
 
 #### 1) What I want to do with **_Wake Up an Egg 2_**
 In the **_Wake Up an Egg 1_**, audiences can just feel that there is something alive inside the egg. 
 
 I expect, in the next stage in this "Wake Up" serial, there will be **an eye opening on the egg**.
 
 &nbsp;
 
 #### 2) Why do I want to "open eye" on the egg?
 
 Obviously, it is not only because this behavior is logically sound in the "wake up" process in the real life, 
 but also because the attention of people is very easy to be attracted by the face of human, and the most attactive part 
 on the face is eyes.
 
 I remenber I was so obsessed with drawing different kinds of eyes of people when I was a little kid.
 And oftentimes, I only drew eyes, because that was already enough for me to imagine to what kind of people were these eyes belong.
 
 So I think it is a good idea to create eyes on my project to personificate it, if I want it relating with audiences emotionally.
  
 &nbsp;
  
 #### 3) How can I "open eyes" on the egg?
 
 * **OUTPUT:** First of all, I need to learn the mechanism of opening an robotic eye:
 
``` 
 - the structure that I need to 3D print out;
 - the components that I need to drive the movements of eyeball and eyelid；
 
```
 
 
 * **INPUT:** Second, figure out what kinds of behaviors I want my audiences to perform to control the movements of robotic eyeball and eyelid. How do these behaviors make sense to them?
 
 ``` 
 - the components (sensers) that I need to trigger the movements of eyeball and eyelid；
 - the locations of these components (sensers)；
```

 * ## Proposal_2.0__Flocking in the Breath
 
 &nbsp;
 
 #### 1) What I want to do with **_Flocking in the Breath_**
 In the **_Wake Up an Egg 1_**, audiences can just feel that there is something alive inside the egg. 
 
 I expect, in the next stage in this "Wake Up" serial, there will be **an eye opening on the egg**.
 
 &nbsp;
 
 #### 2) Why do I want to combine "flocking" with "breath"?
 
 Obviously, it is not only because this behavior is logically sound in the "wake up" process in the real life, 
 but also because the attention of people is very easy to be attracted by the face of human, and the most attactive part 
 on the face is eyes.
 
 I remenber I was so obsessed with drawing different kinds of eyes of people when I was a little kid.
 And oftentimes, I only drew eyes, because that was already enough for me to imagine to what kind of people were these eyes belong.
