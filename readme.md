   ### --Sensor Walk
   
   ### 1_Anti-theft Shopping Carts
   
   ![](https://github.com/yuanfang313/CIM642_Physical_Computing/blob/master/Hw/Hw6_anti-theft%20shopping%20cart.png?raw=true)
   
     **Senario:** when users walk with the shopping carts about to cross a certain perimeter around a grocery, the wheels of the carts will lock automatically; 
     
     *  **Active Input;**
     
     *  **Sensor:** a receiver installed inside one or two of the casters of shopping carts;
     
     *  **Trigger:** the signal that generated by a radio frequency transmitter (connecting with the antenna  buried around the perimeter of the retailerâ€™s property);
     
     *  **Active Output;** 
     
     *  **Mechanism:** when the receiver detected the signal generated by the antenna buried around the grocery, a DC motor inside the wheel will be triggered and starts to rotate, which drives the gears close to it which further drives the bars connected with them pushing the inner rubber ring swelling and finally lock the rubber ring outside ;
      
   &nbsp;  
   
  ### 2_Electronic Stapler
  
 **Senario:** when users slip a stack of papers in the mouth of the stapler, it injects staples automatically ;
 
  * **Passitive Input;** 
    
  *  **Sensor:** may be a sensor that's sensitive to light, like phototransistors ;
     
  *  **Trigger:** a stack of paper is sliped in the mouth of the stapler;
     
  *  **Active Output:** a stape injects out while the led on the stapler lighing;

  ### 3_The Turnstile at the entrance of library      
      
 **Senario:** when users swip their cards, the force added on the levels of turnstile will be release, and users can push in through turnstile;
   
   *  **Passitive Input;**
    
   *  **Sensor:** card reader ;
   
   *  **Trigger:**  a card touches or passes by the swipe-card reader;  
   
   *  **Active Output:** the red led turns green, and the force added on the levels released;
   
   &nbsp;
   
  ### 4_The Ceiling light in the Book Deposit Area
   
**Senario:** when users walk in a certain area in the Book Deposit in the library, the ceiling light will be awaked immediately;
   
   *  **Passitive Input;**
    
   *  **Sensor:** sound sensor ;
    
   *  **Trigger:**  the sound of users;
   
   *  **Active Output:** the light is awaked;
   
   &nbsp;
   
  ### 5_Auto Door for Disables
   
   **Senario:** when users press the button outside the auto door, it will open immediately;
    
   *  **Passitive Input;**
    
   *  **What is user doing:** push the butto  
   
   *  **Active Output:** the door open;
    
   &nbsp;
    
  ### 6_The Redesign of Auto Door
   
  **Senario:** when users near the auto door, it will open immediately;
   
   *  **Active Input;**
   
   *  **Trigger:**  signal sent by a small microconcroller carrying by users; 
   
   *  **Active Output:** the door open;
