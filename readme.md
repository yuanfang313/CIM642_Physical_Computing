 * ## Week6
   * ### Anti-theft Shopping Carts
   
     **Senario:** when users walk with the shopping carts about to cross a certain perimeter around a grocery, the wheels of the carts will lock automatically; 
     *  **Active Input;**
     *  **Sensor:** a receiver installed inside one or two of the casters of shopping carts;
     *  **Trigger:** the signal that generated by a radio frequency transmitter (connecting with the antenna  buried around the perimeter of the retailerâ€™s property);
     
     &nbsp;
     
      *  **Active Output;** 
      *  **Mechanism:** when the receiver detected the signal generated by the antenna buried around the grocery, a DC motor inside the wheel will be triggered and starts to rotate, which drives the gears close to it which further drives the bars connected with them pushing the inner rubber ring swelling and finally lock the rubber ring outside ;
      
   * ### Electronic Stapler
   
     **Senario:** when users slip a stack of papers in the mouth of the stapler, it injects staples automatically ; 
     *  **Passitive Input;**
     *  **Sensor:** may be a sensor that's sensitive to light, like phototransistors ;
     *  **Trigger:** a stack of paper is sliped in the mouth of the stapler;
     
     &nbsp;
     
      *  **Active Output:** a stape injects out while the led on the stapler lighing;
