# 1. About the project

 ## 1-1. What is the title of my project?

### Wake Up An Egg!

In my proposal, I used the word "Hatch", but I found the temperature of our hands was not high enough to make so many animation inside an encased object. So I changed the verb in the title.

## 1-2. Briefly explain why did you want to make this project?

The reason that I want to make this project is that I want to exlore how to influence my audience emotionly.
In the process of **"hatch" or "wake up"** the egg, I expect some emotions are also **"hatching" or "waking up"** inside themselves.

### 1-2-1. Who are the stakeholders?

Basically, my project is an egg that provides an experience of hatching it for visitors in the exhibitions.
But it also can be a toy for children.


### 1-2-2. Find 3 inspiring projects

In fact, any thing that enable certain sets(sequences) of emotions growing inside audiences I'd saw is one part of my inspiration of this project.

### [The Man from Earth]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mOIxyRTY5I

This movie is just an example of any movies that're carefully planning the emotions of audience into its storytelling process. I expecially chose _The Man from Earth_ because it creates so many different emotions just within 1.5 hours and that tiny space, which I may have already forgotten its contents but still vividly remember all the emotions it rooted inside my heart.
