# Midterm Project

* ## What is my project?

Basically, my project is an egg that provides an experience of hatching it for visitors in the exhibitions.
But it also can be a toy for children.


* ## Projects that gave my inspiration

In fact, any thing that enable certain sets(sequences) of emotions growing inside audiences I'd saw is one part of my inspiration of this project.

## [The Man from Earth]

This movie is just an example of any movies that're carefully planning the emotions of audience into its storytelling process. I expecially chose _The Man from Earth_ because it creates so many different emotions just within 1.5 hours and that tiny space, which I may have already forgotten its contents but still vividly remember all the emotions it rooted inside my heart.
